Ease Your Work with SFTP by Using OpenSFTP:
============
OpenSFTP provides a FREE and HANDY set of utilities in pure Java designed to 
ease your work with SFTP. 

OpenSFTP consists of three low-coupling parts:
  * OpenSftp-api. A well designed set of API.
  * OpenSftp-impl. A reference implementation.
  * Pluggable, configurable, and customizable modules, which are now represented in the forms of interceptors and listeners.

It's platform-independent, programmer-friendly, customizable, configurable and configuration-free. 
It's easy to use, easy to extend and easy to troubleshot.

You can use OpenSFTP as a LIGHTWEIGHT SFTP client, 
Or develop your own SFTP client, such as a desktop version, an RIA version 
or a customized version for a certain enterprise application, based on OpenSFTP. 

OpenSFTP is licensed under LGPLv3.

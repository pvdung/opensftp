Ease Your Work with SFTP by Using OpenSFTP
</font></p>
----
OpenSFTP provides a <font color="blue">FREE</font> and <font color="blue">HANDY</font> set of utilities <font color="blue">in pure Java</font> designed to ease your work with SFTP. 
<br><br>
OpenSFTP consists of three low-coupling parts:
  * !OpenSftp-api. A well designed set of API.
  * !OpenSftp-impl. A reference implementation.
  * Pluggable, configurable, and customizable modules, which are now represented in the forms of interceptors and listeners.
<br>
It's platform-independent, <font color="blue">programmer-friendly, customizable, configurable and configuration-free</font>. 
<br>
It's easy to use, easy to extend and easy to troubleshot.
<br><br>
You can use OpenSFTP as a <font color="blue">LIGHTWEIGHT</font> SFTP client,
<br>
Or develop your own SFTP client, such as a desktop version, an RIA version and a customized version for a certain enterprise application, based on OpenSFTP.

For unit testing purpose, SftpUtilFactoryDup is created based on SftpUtilFactory.
SftpUtilFactoryDup is almost the same as SftpUtilFactory 
except that the following fields are declared as protected.
sftpUtilClassName,sftpUtilClassNameInitialized, sftpUtil, sftpUtilInitialized.

SftpUtilMock mocks implement SftpUtil.
